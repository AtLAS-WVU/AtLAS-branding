# AtLAS-branding

**AtLAS** is the modern day carrier pigeon: an open-source system for dispatching, receiving, and tracking personal autonomous delivery drones.

**AtLAS-branding** is the official repository for the branding and art assets related to the AtLAS (*Autonomous Low Altitude Service*) delivery system.

If you're interested in setting up an AtLAS system, you'll also want to visit [**AtLAS-server**](https://github.com/AtLAS-WVU/AtLAS-server), the home of the backend that powers AtLAS, [**AtLAS-embedded**](https://github.com/AtLAS-WVU/AtLAS-embedded), the home of the embedded software running on AtLAS drones, and [**AtLAS-mobile**](https://github.com/AtLAS-WVU/AtLAS-mobile), the home of the Android mobile application that allows users to interface with the system.
